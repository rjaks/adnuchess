# Department Change Cooldown Implementation Summary

## What was implemented:

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added `departmentLastChanged` field to profiles schema to track when the department was last changed

### 2. Backend (Convex) Updates
- **Updated `updateDepartment` mutation**:
  - Added cooldown validation (1 year restriction)
  - Only updates `departmentLastChanged` when department actually changes
  - Returns detailed error messages with remaining days
  - Includes `skipCooldownCheck` parameter for future admin override functionality

- **Added `checkDepartmentCooldown` query**:
  - Returns cooldown status: `canChange`, `remainingDays`, `nextChangeDate`
  - Used by frontend to show appropriate UI states

### 3. Frontend (Vue) Updates
- **Added reactive state variables**:
  - `showDepartmentConfirmModal`: Controls confirmation dialog
  - `departmentCooldown`: Stores cooldown status from backend

- **Enhanced user flow**:
  - `checkDepartmentChangeAndProceed()`: Determines if confirmation is needed
  - `confirmDepartmentChange()`: Executes the change after confirmation
  - `cancelDepartmentChange()`: Cancels and resets the change

- **UI Improvements**:
  - Confirmation modal with clear warning about 1-year restriction
  - Cooldown status indicator in department edit modal
  - Visual cooldown indicator (clock icon) next to department when restricted
  - Enhanced tooltips showing remaining days

### 4. User Experience Features
- **Confirmation Flow**:
  - Shows confirmation modal only when department is actually changing
  - Clear warning about 1-year restriction
  - Shows current vs new department for confirmation

- **Cooldown Display**:
  - Amber warning in department modal when cooldown is active
  - Shows exact number of remaining days
  - Shows next available change date

- **Error Handling**:
  - Backend provides user-friendly error messages
  - Frontend displays specific cooldown errors
  - Graceful handling of edge cases

## Benefits:
1. **Prevents abuse**: Users can only change department once per year
2. **Maintains integrity**: Departmental rankings remain stable
3. **User-friendly**: Clear communication about restrictions and timeframes
4. **Admin-ready**: Framework for admin overrides already in place
5. **Robust**: Handles edge cases and provides clear feedback

## Testing:
- All files compile without errors
- Development server runs successfully
- Ready for end-to-end testing in browser
